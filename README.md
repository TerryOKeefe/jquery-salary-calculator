# jQuery Salary Calculator


Created an input form to collect employee information to then calculate monthly salary budget.


## Description


I built a form that takes in several input employee data points, run calculations, and appends that data to the DOM. The table displays each employee as it gets added. For each employee added, the total monthly budget gets displayed in the bottom right corner. If the monthly budget exceeds $20000 then a red background around the number will display. A delete button appears as employees get displayed. This will remove the employee but the monthly budget will not change.

Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
